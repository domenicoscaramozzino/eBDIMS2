All ensemble files and transition pathways that we simulated during the development and testing of the codes can be freely downloaded from figshare at: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28334204.v1

Animated GIFs of these protein transition pathways that can be also downloaded from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28334195.v1
